Revision history for Perl extension HMM.

0.01  Thd Jul 17 17:54:00 2003
	- Initial alpha release; Just one test up to now, very basic Font-DIR setting
	- Methods for reading out Profile HMMs and producing HMM-Logos
0.02  Fri Jul 25 15:42:00 2003
	- Fix: Better positioning of characters in draw_logo()
0.03  Fri Aug 1 19:31:00 2003
	- Change: Threshold for character display set to 1 instead of 3 for accuracy
	- Added option to display parts of a profile through -startpos -endpos
0.04  Mon, Aug 4 16:40:00 2003
	- Modified character positioning again - Now it should finally be as good as it gets
	- Fixed errors in partial display
0.1   Fri, Aug 15 13:33:00 2003
	- We think it is time for a first release!
	- The parse and simple read functionality has been passed to HMM rather than HMM::Profile
	- Thus, HMM::Profile now inherits from HMM
	- Thus, HMM is not an exporter class any more, so HMM::Profile has to be included explicitly
0.2   Thd, Aug 21 11:23:00 2003
	- Added PFAM direct download support. Thus, libbwww-perl is required now
	- Tried to reduce startup-time by usinf PDL::LiteF rather than PDL
	- Changed the parser to work with strings instead of globs
0.2.1 Tue, Aug 26 14:16:00 2003
	- Added experimental retention-time calculation for insert states
0.3   Fri, Aug 29 12:47:00 2003
	- Modified retention-time calculation. HP is now a sub-column of Insert-States where width is determined by HP*Est.Ret.Time
	- ATTENTION: toWidth is now toHPM and returns a Matrix of all Hitting Probabilities rather than a vector for M and I
0.31  Thd Okt 30 15:24:00 2003
	- Fixed a bug concerning Windows line-breaks
0.32  Thd Nov 20 19:29:00 2003

	- Removed lot's of annoying warnings
0.6   Thd Jan 27 13:56:00 2005

    - Now takes custom font path, size and colouring
    - Removed font path check from Makefile
    - Bug fixed: Exporter not working
